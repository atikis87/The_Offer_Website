# To-Dos
    * Please create a simple landing page interacting with the proposed API.
    * Visually the page consists of header, main part and footer.
        * Header has dummy logo and and few items of navigation (some external links to everything you like) 
        * Main part contains:
            * Dummy headline(s)
            * 2-3 sentences of marketing text (Lorem Ipsum..)
            * Input field to enter the address
            * Offers, which appear after user enters the address.
        * Footer includes dummy links to imprint, contact page, as well as few links to social networks, styled as icons.
    * Input field has Reset button
    * Input field some basic validation
    * Display offers in something like a panel or card each
    * Each offer card contains:
        * name of offer
        * price
        * small expandable description text (e.g. up to 10 Lorem Ipsum words), unique for each offer
        * button to offer details (any external link)
    * Sort the offers based on price and start with the most expensive one.
    * Highlight the first offer somehow (e.g. using a special color/label/icon) but only if more than one offer is provided.
    * Simulate random delay (up to 3 seconds) for loading offers via API. Visualise the process somehow, e.g. showing skeleton loading.
    * Think about appropriate error handling, semantics, accessibility, performance, SEO etc.
    * Use mobile-first approach. Make sure, your page looks solid on smartphone/tablet/desktop.
    * Use any fonts, colors, images you like.
