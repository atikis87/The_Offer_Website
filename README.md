This project was created using HTML CSS and Vanilla JS. I only used framework for the server.


## ðŸ›  Installation & Set Up

1. Install and use the correct version of Node using [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

   ```sh
   nvm install
   ```

3. Start the development server

   ```sh
   npm run start
   ```

   Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view it in the browser.


   ## ðŸš¨ Description
    1. To build the project, I designed the structure in the first round. I used a simple HTML file for this. The simple page consists of 3 sections. A header with a logo and menu items.     In responsive design, the menu can be opened in the form of an icon.
    2. The basis of the main section is the use of the grid. That's what I tried to show. The left side is provided with a minimal header text and input field, where I highlighted the use of CSS keyframes in a text block. A businessman can be seen on the right. I used Adobe photoshop for editing, and also for the background design.
    For the offer part, I used 3 cards, this is written as hard code, because something went wrong while retrieving the data from the json. But its structure is also responsive.
    3. Section 3 is the footer. I used svgs here. I had to get into these at the code level as well. I tried to make it as perfect as possible. This required a lot of collection work.
